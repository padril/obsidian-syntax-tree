# WARNING!
This project is just barely scraped together to work, with a lengthy list of todos. Moreover, it will probably only be updated if it stops working!

## Install

**Installing RSyntaxTree**

- Install Ruby
- Run `gem install rsyntaxtree`
    - If you get an error installing rmagick, make sure you have ImageMagick installed first, and that you DO NOT have ImageMagick 7.x.x or later installed (it causes rmagick to fail)

**Installing this plugin**

- Clone this repo and drop the file into you vault's `.obsidan` folder.
- Restart 

## Usage

- Create a `` ```syntax ``` `` code block, and put the RSyntaxTree code inside it
